This project determines which variables such as, follower count, watch time, stream time and age-content, has the most impact on the average amount of viewers a twitch streamer has. The data was gathered from kaggle that observes the varying measurable features of the top 1000 streamers in 2020. The features include, watch time, average peak viewers, follower count, and many more. Once the data was cleaned, the variables that were related to our project were utilized to create visualizations and linear regression models. From our visualizations and data, we observed that watch time and followers count were the strongest predictiors, within the four variables, to determine the average viewers of a twitch streamer.
